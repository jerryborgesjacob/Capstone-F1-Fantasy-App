# Capstone-F1-Fantasy-App
This repository contains F1 Fantasy League Web Application created as part of a Capstone project.

## Features
- Login and Registration with JSON Web Token.
- Real-World Data through Ergast F1 API
- Create Teams.
- Create Public and Private Leagues
- Admin Panel to control teams and leagues.

### NOTES:
- Login and Admin panels were removed due to error in code. The deployed website is barebone. The code for the intended functions are in the repository. I am actively working on getting the application to work as intended with all the features.
- The some Fantasy League features and leaderboard are being worked on and will be added soon.
